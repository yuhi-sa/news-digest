We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying...

### 16. Contextuality from Single-State Representations: An Information-Theoretic Principle for Adaptive Intelligence
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML
- **Published**: 2026-02-20 05:00 UTC
- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16716
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.16716v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Adaptive systems often operate across multiple contexts while reusing a fixed internal state space due to constraints on memory, representation, or physical resources. Such single-state reuse is ubiquitous in natural and artificial intelligence, yet its fundamental representational consequences remain poorly understood. We show that contextuality is not a peculiarity of quantum mechanics, but an inevitable consequence of single-state reuse in cl...

### 17. Mobility-Aware Cache Framework for Scalable LLM-Based Human Mobility Simulation

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.16727v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large-scale human mobility simulation is critical for applications such as urban planning, epidemiology, and transportation analysis. Recent works treat large language models (LLMs) as human agents to simulate realistic mobility behaviors using structured reasoning, but their high computational cost limits scalability. To address this, we design a mobility-aware cache framework named MobCache that leverages reconstructible caches to enable effic...

### 18. MMCAformer: Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer for Traffic Speed Prediction with Microscopic Connected Vehicle Driving Behavior

- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.16739v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Secondary crash likelihood prediction is a critical component of an active traffic management system to mitigate congestion and adverse impacts caused by secondary crashes. However, existing approaches mainly rely on post-crash features (e.g., crash type and severity) that are rarely available in real time, limiting their practical applicability. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid secondary crash likelihood prediction framework that...

### 21. Quantifying LLM Attention-Head Stability: Implications for Circuit Universality
- **Source**: ArXiv AI/ML

- **Link**: https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16740
- **Summary**: arXiv:2602.16740v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In mechanistic interpretability, recent work scrutinizes transformer "circuits" - sparse, mono or multi layer sub computations, that may reflect human understandable functions. Yet, these network circuits are rarely acid-tested for their stability across different instances of the same deep learning architecture. Without this, it remains unclear whether reported circuits emerge universally across labs or turn out to be idiosyncratic to a particu...
